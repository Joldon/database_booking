-- a stored procedure to verify a booking, and decline any reservations for tables that are already booked under another name. 
-- it uses a transaction statement to perform a rollback if a customer reserves a table thatâ€™s already booked under another name.  
-- The procedure should include two input parameters in the form of booking date and table number.
-- It also requires at least one variable and should begin with a START TRANSACTION statement.
-- Your INSERT statement must add a new booking record using the input parameter's values.
-- Use an IF ELSE statement to check if a table is already booked on the given date. 
-- If the table is already booked, then rollback the transaction. If the table is available, then commit the transaction.
